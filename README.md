This Github repository contains supporting files for my recent Medium post on the probability at play with two notorious bridges

This article focuses on two infamously low-clearance bridges in Australia and the analysis of the rate at which motorists face their wrath. 
At the time of writing this, there are 81 crashes in total (since 2013) and both bridges have had accidents in just the last 2 weeks. 
So as you can appreciate, it is not an infrequent affair.
